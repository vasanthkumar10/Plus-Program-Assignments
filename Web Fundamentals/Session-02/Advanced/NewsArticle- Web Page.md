- `<p>` tag with content: UA College of Pharmacy | Aug. 6, 2014
- `<p>` tag with content: Arguably, snake season is year-round in Arizona, a state known for
its rattlers. But baby rattlesnakes are born in July and August, making these two months
especially dangerous for hikers, gardeners, children and others at high risk of exposure
to rattlesnake bites.

-  Four more `<p>` tags with contents (in order):
    -  So far this year, 74 rattlesnake bites to humans have been reported to the
Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center. Based at the University of Arizona
College of Pharmacy, the center serves the entire state of Arizona with the
exception of Maricopa County, providing free and confidential poison and
medication information to callers around the clock.
    -   Specialists answering the phones at the center regularly receive calls from
Arizonans of all ages who don't realize they were bitten by a rattler. The poison
center urges anyone who feels a mysterious sting, pinch or bite while outdoors to
immediately call the center at 800-222-1222.
    -   "We will ask a few questions that will help you either identify possible snakebite
or eliminate it," said Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona Poison and Drug
Information Center. "With snakebite, the sooner the medical treatment, the better
the outcome, so calling us right away can make a very big difference for the
victims and the medical teams treating them."
    -  The center advises anyone who might come cross paths with rattlesnakes to be
aware of these five things:
-  An ordered list (outside of any `<p>` tag) with the following item contents (in order):
    -  Baby rattlesnakes range in length from 6 to 12 inches and are easily
camouflaged by brush and grass.
    -  Baby rattlesnakes are rattleless until they first shed their skins, so there will be no
infamous "chica-chica" sound before they strike.
    -  Despite their impish size, baby snakes have enough venom to be very dangerous
if they bite a human.
    -  Adult rattlesnakes do not always rattle an audible warning before or while they
are biting.
    -   It's a good idea to call the poison center if you notice an unidentified small cut or
wound, even if you feel no pain. With the lack of telltale rattle warning, people
can be bitten without knowing what has happened until they notice their
symptoms and attribute them to a snakebite.
