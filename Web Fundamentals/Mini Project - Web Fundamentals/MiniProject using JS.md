Here is an outline for a mini-project on JavaScript that includes Fetch API, Promises, Async/Await, Memoization, and Callbacks using the OpenAI API. 

**Project Overview** 

**Project Title: Quote Generator using OpenAI API** 

**Project Overview:** The project aims to generate five quotes on a user-specified topic using the OpenAI API. The web application will have an input field where the user can enter a topic and a button to generate quotes. The quotes will be displayed in a card-like structure on the page. 

**Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OpenAI API **Project Tasks:**

|Write the JavaScript code |1\.5 hours |
|- Create an async function to make API calls using OpenAI API ||
|- Get user input and pass it as a parameter to the API call ||

Total Duration: ~6 hours 

**here is a step-by-step process to complete the project:** 

1. Set up the project directory: 
   1. Create a new project directory on your local machine. 
   1. Inside the project directory, create an index.html file and a style.css file. 
   1. Create a new JavaScript file named main.js to hold your JavaScript code. 
   1. Your folder structure should look like below

3. Create the HTML skeleton: 
   1. Inside the index.html file, create an input field for the user to enter a topic and a button to generate quotes. 
   1. Add an empty container element to hold the quotes. 
3. Style the HTML using CSS: 
   1. Inside the style.css file, add styles to make the HTML look more visually appealing. 
   1. Ensure that the layout is responsive and works on different screen sizes. 
3. Write the JavaScript code: 
- Inside the main.js file, write a function to make an API call to the OpenAI API using the user's input as a parameter. 
- Parse the response from the API and display the five quotes on the page. 
- **Use memoize to cache the API response** so that if the user requests the same topic again, the application can display the cached response without making a new API call. 
- Use **async/await to handle the API call asynchronously.** 
- Make sure the **application is responsive and works on different screen sizes.** 
6. Deploy the project to a hosting service: 
- Deploy the project to a hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Netlify or Heroku so that others can use it. 

**Additional Hints:** 

- **Go to JS\_Mini\_Project folder to Pesto Github Rep and you will find main.js with hints** 
- **hints\_for\_main.js** 
- **Follow the hints for js** 

**Additional Notes:** 

- The project will use async/await to handle the API calls asynchronously. 
- The response from the API will be in JSON format, and the JavaScript code will parse it to extract the quotes. 
- The memoize function will cache the API response to avoid making unnecessary API calls when the user requests the same topic multiple times. 
- The project should be designed with a responsive layout so that it can be viewed on different screen sizes.
